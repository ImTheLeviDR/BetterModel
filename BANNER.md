## ‚ö°Lightweight BlockBench model engine for Bukkit

* * *

This plugin implements **fully server-side 3D model** by using an item-display packet.

- Importing Generic BlockBench model `.bbmodel`
- Auto-generating resource pack
- Playing animation
- Syncing with base entity
- Custom hit box
- Supports 12-limb player animation

#### üî•Why do I create BetterModel even though ModelEngine already exists?
The main reason I created it is:
- To reduce network cost‚ÄîMEG‚Äôs network optimization is outdated and insufficient for modern servers.
- To enable faster updates‚ÄîWe can‚Äôt afford to wait for MEG‚Äôs slow update cycle anymore.
- To provide a more flexible API‚ÄîMEG is closed-source with a very limited API, which makes extending or integrating difficult.
- To restore vanilla behavior-MEG breaks several vanilla entity features and physics, which this project aims to fix.

Also, you can refer [my document](https://github.com/toxicity188/BetterModel/wiki/Compare-with-ModelEngine) to compare both ModelEngine and BetterModel.

This plugin, of course, implements a Generic BlockBench model with animation.

####  Optimization
BetterModel has been trying many kind of CPU and network cost reduce.
- culling by sight
- async entity spawn/despawn handling
- parallel packet bundling
- and much more

You can see the report of network optimization in [here](https://github.com/toxicity188/BetterModel/wiki/Report-about-network-cost-about-two-model-plugin-(ModelEngine,-BetterModel)).

#### Custom hitbox

* * *
This plugin provides **custom hitbox** both client and server. (tracking animation rotation)

#### MythicMobs support
* * *

* * *
Like MEG, This plugin supports **MythicMobs**, you can use some MEG's mechanics in BetterModel too.

This plugin supports **player model with using user's custom skin without textures**.
